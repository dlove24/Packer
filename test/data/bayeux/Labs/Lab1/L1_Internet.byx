[h1 Connecting to the Internet]

[h2 Aim]

During this lab you will create a small network, linking a Windows client to
the Internet via an intermediate router. You will start with a very simple
set-up, and then gradually add and configure the intermediate router to
produce the final configuration.

For the purpose of this lab, you only need to set-up the [ac TCPIP] network
stack: we will do most of our network testing using [tt ping] to start with.
Once you have the [ac TCPIP] network working, try enabling other services and
see what happens.

[note]
This lab may seem arcane and complex at first sight, but is
actually very simple. The hard part is learning to work through the
configuration of each client, router and patch panel in a methodical
manner. Once you know how to do this, you should be able to replicate
your efforts in a few minutes. It will probably take you longer than
that on the first few tries, however...

[h2 Recommended Reading]

Most of the background documentation is available on
the module site, under the notes for [e Lab 1].

If you have not used a Unix system before, have a look
at the [e Brief Guide to Unix] available on the module Wiki.
You will also find links to the Unix manual ([tt man]) pages
of the commands used in this lab.

Finally, if you need a reminder of how [ac IPv4]
addressing works, read the [e Short Note on IP Addressing]
available on the module web-site.

[h2 Connecting a Client Directly to the Internet]

The first host we will set-up will be a single Windows XP client, connected
directly to the Internet via an [ac ADSL] router. For many of you, this set-up
will be familiar: once you know how the lab works, you can move onto the
subsequent problems.

You can find a copy of the Windows XP client on the lab machines system disk,
in the folder [tt C:\VMWare\Virtual Machines\Windows XP Pro SP3]. Copy the
entire folder to [tt D:\], and open the folder. Click on the file [tt Windows
XP Pro SP3.vmx] inside the folder [tt D:\Windows XP Pro SP3]. VMWare should
now start, opening the [tt Windows XP Pro SP3] image.

[note]
[e Before] you start the image, check the Ethernet card in VMWare is set to
'Bridged' mode. If necessary, change the network type of the virtual interface
card to 'Bridged' mode[fn We will be using real hardware in this lab, so you
need to tell VMWare to direct everything to the underlying network hardware
used by the host. We will later look at situations where we use a mix of
virtual and real hardware.].
[end]

When you are ready, click the green [e Run] button . Alternatively, select [tt
VM] $\rightarrow$ [tt Power] $\rightarrow$ [tt Power On] from the menu bar.
The virtual machine should now begin to start loading.

VMWare may ask you if you have 'moved or copied' the virtual machine. Select
'copied' and VMWare will regenerate the MAC address[fn VMWare generates the
[sc mac] addresses for the virtual machines when the image is first created.
Selecting [e copied] forces VMWare to regenerate the [sc mac] addresses,
allowing you to have multiple images attached to the same network. If you
select [e move], VMWare would use the original [sc mac] address, and everyone
would end up with the same one. At the very least this will cause confusion,
but it would normally prevent the networking working at all.].

While the virtual Windows image boots, cable your host to the [ac ADSL] line
using a switch. Each group should use their own switch to start with, in order
to reduce potential problems. Once your group has got everything up and
running, you should be able to combine machines with other groups to grow the
sub-net.

For the moment, though, turn you attention the small patch panel on the bench in front of you and the larger patch panels at the back of the lab.

Before you move to the patch panel at the back of the room, note the number
underneath the [s red] faceplate (which should have a patch cable in it
leading to the back of your computer). The number should be between [tt 01]
and [tt 30]. Make a note of the number, and move to the back of the lab.

At the back of the lab inside one of the middle cabinets, you should see a
small black patch panel below a large green one (it will have 24 ports on it).
Ports 1--5 of the [s black] patch panel will have an [ac ADSL] router
behind them, on the [tt 192.168.7.0/24] subnet. Select a free port (other
groups will be using other [ac ADSL] routers), and patch from the selected
port to a [e free] switch. You can use the same switch as a another group if
your really want, but you can avoid someone else's problems by reserving a
switch for your group. [e Make a note] of your chosen port number on the
[s black] patch panel --- you will need it later to work out the gateway
address to use for your clients. Use [ref table:PortNum] to find the
gateway address from the number of your [s black] patch-panel port.

While you are at the back of the lab, patch from your chosen switch to the
port on the [s red] patch panel where your lab computer connects to. Your
port will have the same number as the red faceplate on your bench: [e i.e.]
the number you made a note of earlier. For example, if your bench faceplate
has the number [tt 12] below it, patch from port [tt 12] on the red patch
panel to your chosen switch.

[table:PortNum]
Port Number | Gateway Address
------------------------------
[tt 1]      | [tt 192.168.7.1/24] 
[tt 2]      | [tt 192.168.7.2/24] 
[tt 3]      | [tt 192.168.7.3/24] 
[tt 4]      | [tt 192.168.7.4/24] 
[tt 5]      | [tt 192.168.7.5/24] 
[tt 6]      | [tt 192.168.7.6/24] 
[caption Mapping [ac ADSL] Patch-Panel Ports to Gateway Addresses]
[end]

[note] 
The [ac ADSL] routers on Ports [tt 1], [tt 2] and [tt
4] will [e require] a crossover cable to work correctly. The [ac ADSL] routers
on Ports [tt 3], [tt 5] and [tt 6] can be patched using either a
straight-through or a crossover cable[fn Not all our [ac ADSL] routers are
identical, and those living on Ports [tt 1], [tt 2] and [tt 4] do not have [e
auto-sensing] Ethernet ports. The ports on the other [ac ADSL] routers can
detect where the [sc tx] and [sc rx] pairs are in the patch cable, and
configure themselves accordingly.
[end]

[question]
[item For routers without auto-sensing Ethernet ports, why do we have to use a cross-over patch cable to connect the router to the switch?.]
[end]

[medskip]

When everything is patched, your virtual Windows machine should be connected
to an ASDL router. All you need to do now is to configure your Windows
machine, so that you can connect to the Internet via the [ac ADSL] router.

[medskip]

Inside the Windows client image, click [tt Control Panel] $\rightarrow$ [tt
Network and Internet Connections] $\rightarrow$ [tt Network Connections] to
open the list of adapters. You should see the VMWare bridged connection in
here, and it should be listed as '[tt Connected]'

Right-click on the icon for the VMWare adapter, and then click [tt Properties]
from the pop-up menu. Windows should bring up the list of protocols and
services for this adapter.

Find the [tt Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)] service, and then click [tt
Properties] to alter the [ac IPv4] parameters for the VMWare adapter. You will
probably find the boxes in the dialogue box greyed out, as Windows will try to
get everything from a [ac DHCP] server.

Tell Windows you want to enter the [ac IPv4] address and sub-net mask
manually, and enter an [ac IPv4] address in the form [tt 192.168.7.1x] where
[tt x] is your computer number. For instance if you are connect to the bench
patch panel [tt 15], your [ac IPv4] address will be [tt 192.168.7.115]. Your
sub-net mask will be the same as that for your [ac ADSL] router. Finally you
will need to put in the details for your [ac ADSL] router for your default
gateway. You will also want to put the [ac IPv4] address of the [ac ADSL]
router in the box marked [tt Preferred [ac DNS] server]. Leave the [tt
Alternate [ac DNS] server] box blank.

Close the sequence of dialogue boxes, and Windows should reconfigure the
adapter.

[medskip]

Once the VMWare adapter has been configured, you will need to make sure
everything is working. Open a command shell, by going to [tt Start Menu]
$\rightarrow$ [tt Run]. Type [tt cmd], and press [tt Enter] and you should see
a command prompt.

Now run the a basic sequence of service tests as follows

[command]
  ping www.myertor.com
[end]
[command]
  ping 81.187.233.190
[end]
[command]
  tracert www.myertor.com
[end]
[command]
  tracert 81.187.233.190
[end]

[h3 Questions]

[ol]

  [item  What is the output of [tt tracert] commands? Is this what you would expect? Why?
[end]

[h2 Setting up the [ac WAN] Interface of the Sub-net Border Router]

Now we have a known working connection to the Internet, we will reconfigure
the Windows client to connect to an intermediate border router. The Windows
client will connect to sub-net [tt 172.20.56.0/27], using an intermediate
border router to regain the connection to the Internet.

Our intermediate router will be running [tt pfSense], and you can download a
copy of the [tt pfSense Router 01] image from the lab page on the module
web-site.

[medskip]

To set-up the [tt pfSense Router] image, download a copy of the [tt pfSense
Router 01] image from the module Wiki. By default Internet Explorer will try
to save the image on your [tt F:] --- and will probably fail. Instead,
right-click on the link shown in the module web-page, and click [tt Save As]
to put the file on [tt D:\]. When the download finishes, open [tt D:\] and
right-click on the file '[tt pfSense\_Router\_01.7z]' and select [tt 7-zip]
$\rightarrow$ [tt Extract Here] to open the archive. When 7-zip finishes, you
should see a folder called '[tt pfSense Router]' in [tt D:\]. Open the [tt
pfSense Router] folder, and double-click on the file '[tt pfSense Router.vmx]'
to open VMWare.

Your [tt pfSense Router] will have two virtual Ethernet cards. The first card
[e must] be set to 'Bridged' mode, and will be used to connect the border
router to the [ac ADSL] router. In [tt pfSense], the virtual Ethernet
interface will be called the [tt WAN] interface.

Your second virtual Ethernet interface [e must] be set to 'Host-only' mode.
Later we will connect the Windows client image to this interface. Under [tt
pfSense] this interface will be known as the [tt LAN] image.

Make sure the [tt pfSense Router] interfaces are set-up correctly, and start
the image using the [e Run] icon from the toolbar (or on the image summary
screen). Again, if asked whether the image has been 'Moved or copied', select
'copied' and let the image continue to boot.

[medskip]

[figure:pfBoot]
  [image pfSense_menu]
  [caption The [tt pfSense] menu]
[end]

When the image has finished booting, you should see a text menu with a list of
options as shown in [ref pfBoot]. Some [tt pfSense] options can be
configured by this text-based interface: most of the options, though, are
configured by a web-based interface.

We will look at the web-based interface very shortly. Usually when configuring
[tt pfSense] you set-up the router on the [ac LAN] first, and then use the
web-based interface to configure the [ac WAN] interface. Hence option [tt 2)]
on the text-menu to set the [ac LAN] [ac IPv4] address: [tt pfSense] assumes
that once the [ac LAN] [ac IPv4] is set, everything else can be done through
the web interface.

However, in this lab we are effectively working 'backwards' --- moving from
the Internet connection back towards the client. This allows us to check the
connection at each stage, but means we have to do a bit more work to set-up
[tt pfSense].

[medskip]

[figure:pfShell]
  pfSense_shell]
  [caption Calling Up the Shell in [tt pfSense]]
[end]

Our first task is therefore to set-up the [tt WAN] interface, making sure our
sub-net router can talk to the [ac ADSL] router. We will do this using the [tt
pfSense] command line, and the [man:8 ifconfig] command. Type [tt 8] and press
[tt Return] to select the [tt 8) Shell] option. This will open a command line,
as shown in [ref pfShell]

[medskip]

You can read about the [man:8 ifconfig] command from the links on the module
Wiki. Use [man:8 ifconfig] command to [e temporarily][fn All Unix systems use
the 'interface configuration' command [man:8 ifconfig] to perform [e
temporary] configuration of the network interfaces. Some, e.g. Silicon
Graphics Irix, use [man:8 ifconfig] to perform permanent alterations as well.
Under [tt pfSense] (FreeBSD) you will have to edit the the [tt /etc/rc.d] file
if you want your configurations to survive a reboot of the image. Have a look
at the [e FreeBSD Handbook] for more details.] set the [ac IPv4] address of
the [tt em0] interface. The basic syntax of the [man:8 ifconfig] is

[command]
  ifconfig <interface> inet <address> netmask <mask>
[end]

You might want to type

[command]
  ifconfig
[end]

and examine the output to get a feel for the command.

[medskip]

Our [tt WAN] interface is [tt em0][fn See the list of interfaces displayed in the login screen, or in [ref pfBoot]]. Thus the basic syntax will be

[command]
  ifconfig em0 inet <address> netmask <mask>
[end]

Set the interface address using pattern [tt 192.168.n.1x], where [tt x] is the
number of your bench faceplate and [tt n] is the sub-net used by your [ac
ADSL] router. For instance, if your computer is connected to faceplate [tt 12]
on [tt Port 3], use the [ac IPv4] address [tt 192.168.7.112]. The sub-net mask
obviously remains as before. Use

[command]
  ifconfig
[end]

and review the output to make sure everything is as you expect.

[medskip]

With the interface address set, try the basic service tests again

[command]
  ping www.myertor.com
[end]

[command]
  ping 81.187.233.190
[end]

[command]
  traceroute www.myertor.com
[end]

[command]
  traceroute 81.187.233.190
[end]

[h3 Questions]

[ol]
  [item  What is the output of the [tt ping] commands? Is this what you would expect? Why?
  [item  What is the output of [tt traceroute] commands? Is this what you would expect? Why?
[end]

[medskip]

Now try setting the default gateway of the border router to the address of the
[ac ADSL] modem. You will need to use the [man:8 route][fn See the lab notes
on the module Wiki for more details of the [man:8 route] command.] command to
tell [tt pfSense] where to send foreign packets to.

Although [man:8 route] can do many things to the routing table, for our purposes the basic command we need is 

[command]
  route add default <gateway\_address>
[end]

where [tt <gateway\_address>] is the address of the [ac ADSL] router. Set the
default gateway using the [man:8 route] command and try the basic service
tests again

[command]
  ping www.myertor.com
[end]

[command]
  ping 81.187.233.190
[end]

[command]
  traceroute www.myertor.com
[end]

[command]
  traceroute 81.187.233.190
[end]

[h3 Questions]

[ol]
  [item  What is the output of the [tt ping] commands this time? Is this what you would expect? Why?
  [item  What is the output of [tt traceroute] commands this time? Is this what you would expect? Why?
[end]

[h2 Setting up the [ac LAN] Interface of the Sub-net Border Router]

Once the [ac WAN] interface is set-up and known to be working, you will need
to set-up the [ac LAN] interface. Once both interfaces have been set-up, we
can connect the Windows client to the Internet via the newly configured border
router.

[medskip]

As we mentioned before, setting up the [ac LAN] interface in [tt pfSense] is
considerably easier. Setting the [ac LAN] interface by hand fits the 'natural'
way of setting-up [tt pfSense] in most environments.

If you are still on the [tt pfSense] command line from the previous task, type

[command]
  exit
[end]

to return to the [tt pfSense] menu. 

[note]
Do not reset the router to return to the [tt pfSense] menu]. If you reset the router your [ac WAN] configuration will be lost and you will have to re-configure the interface before you go any further][fn Remember we have only set-up the [ac WAN] interface temporarily. We need to use the Web interface (or edit a few configuration file) to make your changes permanent)].
[end]

When you can see the [tt pfSense] menu again, select option [tt 2)] to start
the configuration of the [ac LAN] interface. This should start a small
text-based wizard, allowing you to specify the interface address and sub-net
mask. When asked whether you can a [ac DHCP] server, select [tt no] or '[tt
n]'.

You don't have to use the interface wizard: now you know how to use the [man:8
ifconfig] command you can set-up the [tt em1] ([ac LAN]) interface as before.
If you want to set-up the interface this way, you will need to open a
command line shell as before.

Whichever way you choose to set-up the [ac LAN] interface, you will need to
use the same information. In both cases, set-up your [ac LAN] interface as the
[e lowest] use-able address on the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] network.

[questions]
  [item  What is the lowest use-able address on the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] network?
  [item  What is the sub-net mask of the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] network in dotted decimal form?
  [item  What is the broadcast address address of the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] network in dotted decimal form?
[end]

[h2 Connecting the Windows Client]

With both the [ac WAN] and [ac LAN] interfaces configured, you should now be
able to connect the Windows client to the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] sub-net. [e You
will need to change the virtual interface type from 'Bridged' to 'Host-Only'
before the client will connect properly]. Give the Windows client the highest
host (last use-able) address on the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] sub-net.

[h3 Questions]

[ol]
  [item  What is the last use-able address on the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] network?
  [item  Which [ac IPv4] address should you use as the default gateway on the [tt 172.20.56.30/27] sub-net, given the configuration already done for the previous task?
[end]

Set the default gateway on the Windows client. You can also tell Windows to
use the same address for the [ac DNS] resolver[fn Our router runs a [ac DNS]
forwarder, which should pick up the correct [ac DNS] resolver addresses from
the [ac ADSL] router.]. Try the basic service tests again

[command]
  ping www.myertor.com
[end]

[command]
  ping 81.187.233.190
[end]

[command]
  traceroute www.myertor.com
[end]

[command]
  traceroute 81.187.233.190
[end]

[h3 Questions]

[ol]
  [item  What is the output of the [tt ping] commands? Is this what you would expect? Why?]
  [item  What is the output of [tt traceroute] commands? Is this what you would expect? Why?]
[end]

As a final check, you should now be able to use the [tt pfSense] web interface
from the Windows client. Open Internet Explorer in Windows and type in the
address of the sub-net border router. The login name is [tt admin], and the
password is [tt gold].
