[h1 Resources]

[h2 Network Guides]

This module focus on mixed networks, running both special purpose operating
systems such as Cisco's IOS to the more general Unix and Windows server and
client systems. Behind the lectures and labs, we will be using a single
network to explore the themes and technologies used in this module. This
network is based on a semi-fictional company called Myertor.

[h2 Operating System Guides]

Although we will be using both Windows and Unix operating systems in the labs,
we won't go into many details of the installation or administration of either.

[h2 Recommended Texts]

[h3 Course Site]

For this course, we will not be using a 'core text'. Instead, each lab and
lecture will have a link to relevant information either in this module site,
or elsewhere. However, this will be the [e basic] information. Networking is a
vast topic, and we will deliberately move through quite big topics at a fair
pace.

You might, therefore, want to supplement your reading with other texts that
deal with the same material in different ways, or in greater depth. We have
therefore selected three books (actually two books and a series) to help guide
your reading around the topics introduced here. Where appropriate, you will
find links to these three books from topics in the module site. You do not
have to read anything from these books: but your understanding of the topic
and the module will be greatly enhanced if you do. You may also find some of
the lab exercises easier as well, as some of these books provide alternative
methods and tools for some of the experiments we will do in the networking
labs.

[h3 Textbooks]

If you want to supplement your understanding of material presented in this
course, we strongly recommend The TCP/IP Guide by Charles Kozierok. We will be
using the electronic version, available
[link from the author|http://www.tcpipguide.com/order+the+guide.htm]. All the
page numbers to [e The TCP/IP Guide] in the module site will refer version 3
of this text.

You can also obtain a paper copy of The TCP/IP Guide, the relevant details are

You can order a copy from Blackwells, or this books is also available [link
from
Amazon|http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159327047X/qid=1126278702/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance&s=books&n=507846].

Many of you will have met Andrew Tanenbaum's Computer networks from earlier modules, so we will include references to this text where appropriate. The full reference to this text is

[end]

Library Record: [link http://catalogue.shu.ac.uk/record=b1370370a]

If you really want a copy, this can also be ordered from Blackwells if you want, or Amazon. Tanenbaum is also very widely available second hand, so you should be able to pick up a copy relatively cheaply if you want to.

We will also be making use of Richard Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated: full reference

[end]

Stevens is especially useful for those involved in writing programs operating over TCP/IP networks, but is also good for those who want an in-depth look at the bottom layers of modern operating systems. Unless you're feeling rich, we don't recommend you buy these books. Instead consult the on-line version available from the library

Library Record: [http://catalogue.shu.ac.uk/record=b1502121a]

For many of the low-level details of networking technology, you need to read
[e Data and Computer Communications] by William Stallings. This book has a
large number of editions: we will be using the 8th edition available in the
library. You can readily find earlier editions of this book second-hand: for
most of the topics we are interested in, the earlier editions will be fine.
